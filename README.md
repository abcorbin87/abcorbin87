- 👋 Hi, I’m @abcorbin87
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics and writing R shiny apps for fun (check out the generative art app that I built that utilizes the aRtsy package). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning proteomics and spatial transcriptomics analysis in more detail, and working on mastering python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything involving bioinformatics!
